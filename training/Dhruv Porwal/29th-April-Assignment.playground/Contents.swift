//Basic Operators

//Unary operators operate on a single target (such as -a). Unary prefix operators appear immediately before their target (such as !b), and unary postfix operators appear immediately after their target (such as c!).
//
//Binary operators operate on two targets (such as 2 + 3) and are infix because they appear in between their two targets.
//
//Ternary operators operate on three targets. Like C, Swift has only one ternary operator, the ternary conditional operator (a ? b : c).

//a ? b : c if(a== true) then b else c

let b = 10 // = this is defined as assignment operator
let (x, y) = (1, 2) // here, (x,y) is the tuple

/*
1 + 2       // equals 3
5 - 3       // equals 2
2 * 3       // equals 6
10.0 / 2.5
*/

//Comparison Operators in

//Equal to (a == b)
//
//Not equal to (a != b)
//
//Greater than (a > b)
//
//Less than (a < b)
//
//Greater than or equal to (a >= b)
//
//Less than or equal to (a <= b)

//increment/ decrement using += or -=

//COMPARISON OF TUPLES:

//(1, "zebra") < (2, "apple")   // true because 1 is less than 2; "zebra" and "apple" aren't compared
//(3, "apple") < (3, "bird")    // true because 3 is equal to 3, and "apple" is less than "bird"
//(4, "dog") == (4, "dog")      // true because 4 is equal to 4, and "dog" is equal to "dog"


("blue", -1) < ("purple", 1)        // OK, evaluates to true

//("blue", true) < ("purple", false)        // OK, evaluates to true
//("blue", false) < ("purple", true)  // Error because < can't compare Boolean values

//These cannot be compared because true and false aren't comparable

//The Swift standard library includes tuple comparison operators for tuples with fewer than seven elements. To compare tuples with seven or more elements, you must implement the comparison operators yourself.

//("blue", false) < ("purple", true)

//while moving from left to right we are first of all comparing numerical values

//You can compare two tuples if they have the same type and the same number of values. Tuples are compared from left to right, one value at a time

//Optionals Basics:

//a != nil ? a! : b


let defaultColorName = "red"
var userDefinedColorName: String?   // defaults to nil


var colorNameToUse = userDefinedColorName ?? defaultColorName

//forceful unwrapping a!

//if let unwrapping

var a :String? = "hey"
if let value = a{
    
    print("as expected value of a is \(value)")
}else{
    print("value of a is nil")
}


//Ranges in swift
for index in 1...5 {
    print("\(index) times 5 is \(index * 5)")
}


//Half ranges
let names = ["Anna", "Alex", "Brian", "Jack"]
let count = names.count
for i in 0..<count {
    print("Person \(i + 1) is called \(names[i])")
}

//One-Sided Ranges
for name in names[2...] {
    print(name)
}
// Brian
// Jack

//The half-open range operator also has a one-sided form
for name in names[..<2] {
    print(name)
}

for name in names[...2] {
    print(name)
}
// Anna
// Alex
// Brian


//.conrtains() function to check presence of elements in array

//range.contains(7)   // false
//range.contains(4)   // true
//range.contains(-1)


//Logical NOT (!a)
//
//Logical AND (a && b)
//
//Logical OR (a || b)


// logical NOT operator
let allowedEntry = false
if !allowedEntry {
    print("ACCESS DENIED")
}

let enteredDoorCode = true
let passedRetinaScan = false
if enteredDoorCode && passedRetinaScan {
    print("Welcome!")
} else {
    print("ACCESS DENIED")
}

//combining logical operators:

//we promote combining of logical operators

if( true && (2 == 3 && 4 == 4)) {
    print("all the best")

//Strings Are Value Typesin


//in swift strings are not array of characters in direct sense
var fan : String = "Value 1"
var fan2 = fan

//print(fan2[6]) wrong
//
//As mentioned above, different characters can require different amounts of memory to store, so in order to determine which Character is at a particular position, you must iterate over each Unicode scalar from the start or end of that String. For this reason, Swift strings canâ€™t be indexed by integer values.
//
//Use the startIndex property to access the position of the first Character of a String. The endIndex property is the position after the last character in a String. As a result, the endIndex property isnâ€™t a valid argument to a stringâ€™s subscript. If a String is empty, startIndex and endIndex are equal.


var greeting = "Hello"

print(greeting[greeting.startIndex])
//subscript is get only

greeting = "r"

print(greeting[greeting.startIndex])

//Counting Characters

var word = "hey"
word.count


greeting = "Halo"

greeting[greeting.startIndex]
// G
greeting[greeting.index(before: greeting.endIndex)]
// !
greeting[greeting.index(after: greeting.startIndex)]
// u

greeting = "Hello"
let index = greeting.index(greeting.startIndex, offsetBy: 4)//after startingIndex from 1st position
print(greeting[index])
// o

     /*The endIndex property is the position after the last character in a String. As a result, the endIndex property isnâ€™t a valid argument to a stringâ€™s subscript. If a String is empty, startIndex and endIndex are equal.*/

greeting[greeting.index(before: greeting.endIndex)]
//
for ind in greeting.indices {
    print(" \(ind) \(greeting[ind]) ", terminator: "")
}
// Prints "G u t e n   T a g ! "
//
//You can use the startIndex and endIndex properties and the index(before:), index(after:), and index(_:offsetBy:) methods on any type that conforms to the Collection protocol. This includes String, as shown here, as well as collection types such as Array, Dictionary, and Set.


//Prefix and Suffix Equality
